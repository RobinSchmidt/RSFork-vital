This is a fork of the source code repository of the software synthesizer "Vital" written by 
Matt Tytel and originally published here:

https://github.com/mtytel/vital

The fork was created by Robin Schmidt (that's me) and this file is meant to serve as a log for my 
modifications. Maybe not all of them but the more important ones. I'll list them in reverse 
chronological order in the format: 
YYYY/MM/DD: I modified...bla blah bla....


2024/01/24: Immediately after forking the original repo on github and then cloning my new fork to a 
            local folder, I created a new branch named "work" and switched to it.
