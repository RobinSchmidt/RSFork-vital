Maybe rename the forked repo to "vital". This can be done on GitHub: go to the repo 

  -> Settings -> Repository name

It seems uncommon to prepend a repo name with some meta-info about what fork it is. Nobody else does 
that. Just check out all the other forks and the forks of surge.


Check out "Vitalium" which is a community maintained fork of Vital. I'm not sure, what the official
repo for Vitalium is, but I found this after a short search:

https://github.com/DISTRHO/DISTRHO-Ports/tree/master/ports-juce6.0/vitalium
