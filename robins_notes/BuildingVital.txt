Vital seems to optionally use the Intel Performance Primitives (IPP) library for the FFT with an
option to fall back to KissFFT when IPP is not available. So, to build Vital, one must either 
install the IPP library or tweak the compilation settings in the .jucer file to set some INTEL_IPP=1 
preprocessor macro to INTEL_IPP=0 and then re-generate the project files for all the IDEs like 
Visual Studio etc. Installers (online and offline) for IPP can be obtained from here:
